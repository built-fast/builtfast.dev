# Code of Conduct

We expect everyone contributing to the BuiltFast Developers community to follow these guidelines, whether on GitHub, in discussions, or anywhere we collaborate.

- Participants will be tolerant of opposing views.
- Participants must ensure that their language and actions are free of personal attacks and disparaging personal remarks.
- When interpreting the words and actions of others, participants should always assume good intentions.
- Behaviour which can be reasonably considered harassment will not be tolerated.
