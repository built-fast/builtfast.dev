The BuiltFast Engineering team is a founder led group of web hosting veterans
who are passionate about building fast, reliable, and secure platforms and
software. We're focused on bringing true service back to the hosting
spaceâ€”helping people succeed online, whether they're running a food blog,
building the next big startup, or anything in between.

We believe in giving back to the developer community that shaped our careers.
We're sharing our insights into technology and hosting, along with the tools,
scripts, and utilities we build to deliver on our
core principle: we win when you win.

## Our Philosophy

- **Security-first mindset** --- Real businesses can't afford shortcuts
- **Quality over speed** --- Build it right the first time
- **People over profit** --- Long-term relationships matter more than short-term
  gains
- **Hands-on leadership** --- Founded by developers who still love to code

## What You'll Find Here

As we grow, this space will house open-source projects and writing that
reflect our commitment to:

- Practical solutions that solve real problems
- Developer experience that doesn't sacrifice security
- Performance tools built from hosting industry experience
- Code that's been battle-tested in production environments

All projects are MIT-licensed and available for anyone to use, adapt, or
contribute to.
