API routes have been simplified to remove unnecessary parent IDs when you already have the child resource ID. If you have an environment, deployment, or secret ID, you no longer need to include site or environment IDs in the path.

### Environments
Routes for individual environments no longer require the site ID:

| Before | After |
|--------|-------|
| `GET /sites/{site}/environments/{env}` | `GET /environments/{env}` |
| `PUT /sites/{site}/environments/{env}` | `PUT /environments/{env}` |
| `DELETE /sites/{site}/environments/{env}` | `DELETE /environments/{env}` |
| `POST /sites/{site}/environments/{env}/database/reset-password` | `POST /environments/{env}/database/reset-password` |
| `GET /sites/{site}/environments/{env}/ssl` | `GET /environments/{env}/ssl` |
| `POST /sites/{site}/environments/{env}/ssl/nudge` | `POST /environments/{env}/ssl/nudge` |
| `GET /sites/{site}/environments/{env}/deployments` | `GET /environments/{env}/deployments` |
| `POST /sites/{site}/environments/{env}/deployments` | `POST /environments/{env}/deployments` |
| `POST /sites/{site}/environments/{env}/rollback` | `POST /environments/{env}/rollback` |
| `GET /sites/{site}/environments/{env}/secrets` | `GET /environments/{env}/secrets` |
| `POST /sites/{site}/environments/{env}/secrets` | `POST /environments/{env}/secrets` |
| `GET /sites/{site}/environments` | `GET /environments[site={site}]` |

### Deployments
Individual deployment routes no longer require site or environment IDs:

| Before | After |
|--------|-------|
| `GET /sites/{site}/environments/{env}/deployments/{deploy}` | `GET /deployments/{deploy}` |

### Secrets
Individual secret routes no longer require site or environment IDs:

| Before | After |
|--------|-------|
| `GET /sites/{site}/environments/{env}/secrets/{secret}` | `GET /secrets/{secret}` |
| `PUT /sites/{site}/environments/{env}/secrets/{secret}` | `PUT /secrets/{secret}` |
| `DELETE /sites/{site}/environments/{env}/secrets/{secret}` | `DELETE /secrets/{secret}` |

### Unchanged Routes
Routes that require parent scope remain nested:
- `POST /sites/{site}/environments` — creating needs parent
- `POST /sites/{site}/db/imports` — site-level DB operation
- `GET /sites/{site}/db/imports/{import}` — site-scoped
- `POST /sites/{site}/db/imports/{import}/run` — site-scoped
- `GET /sites/{site}/db/exports/{export}` — site-scoped

### Required Actions
- Update any API calls using the old nested routes to use the new simplified paths
- Remove `{site}` and `{env}` path segments when operating on resources by their direct ID
