### Breaking Changes
- API key abilities renamed from plural to singular format:
  - `sites:read` → `site:read`
  - `sites:write` → `site:write`
  - `domains:read` → `domain:read`
  - `domains:write` → `domain:write`
  - `logs:read` → `log:read`
  - `webhooks:read` → `webhook:read`
  - `webhooks:write` → `webhook:write`
  - `secrets:read` → `secret:read`
  - `secrets:write` → `secret:write`
- API responses now return abilities without the `vector:` prefix
