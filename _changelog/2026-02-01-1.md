### Event Log Enhancements
- Event logs now capture actor information for API-triggered actions
- Each event includes an `actor` object with:
    - `ip` - The IP address of the request
    - `token_name` - The name of the API token used

### API Response
- `GET /vector/events` responses now include the `actor` field when available
- The `actor` field is omitted for system-triggered events (scheduled tasks, internal queue jobs)
