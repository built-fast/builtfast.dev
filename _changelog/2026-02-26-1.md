### API Improvements

- Added `scope` parameter to backup creation (`full`, `database`, `files`) with `full` as default
- Replaced single `snapshot_id` field with separate `file_snapshot_id` and `database_snapshot_id` fields on backup responses

### New Features

- **Backup Downloads** -- New endpoints for downloading backup archives:
  - `POST /api/v1/vector/sites/{site}/backups/{backup}/downloads` -- Initiate an async backup download
  - `GET /api/v1/vector/sites/{site}/backups/{backup}/downloads/{download}` -- Check download status and retrieve presigned URL
- Download lifecycle: `pending` -> `processing` -> `completed` (with presigned S3 URL) or `failed`
