### API Improvements
- All Vector API endpoints now enforce stricter state validation with clear error messages

### Environment Operations
- Terminate only allowed for `active`, `suspended`, or `failed` states
- Returns 422 if already terminated, termination in progress, or in transitional state (e.g., provisioning)

### Site Operations
- Terminate only allowed for `active` or `suspended` states
- Returns 422 if already terminated or termination in progress
- Suspend returns 422 if already suspended or suspension in progress
- Unsuspend returns 422 if already active or unsuspension in progress

### Deployment Operations
- Deploy and rollback require environment in `active` state
- Returns 422 if deployment or rollback already in progress
