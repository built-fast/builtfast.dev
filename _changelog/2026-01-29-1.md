### Breaking Changes

- Dev container events consolidated under `site.*` namespace

### New Features
- Granular lifecycle events with `.started`, `.completed`, `.failed` phases for provisioning, suspension, unsuspension, and termination
- Deployment rollback events (`deployment.rollback.*`)
- WAF events for rate limits, IP blocks, and referrer rules
- Secret management events
- Domain events
- API key events
- Cache purge events
