  Every open source project needs a license. We chose MIT for all of ours.
  Here's why we think it's the right choice for developer tools.

Every open source project needs a license. Without one, your code exists in a
legal gray area where potential users can't be certain of their rights. We
chose the MIT License for all BuiltFast projects. Here's why.

## What the MIT License Actually Says

The MIT License is remarkably short. It grants anyone permission to use, copy,
modify, merge, publish, distribute, sublicense, and sell copies of the
software. The only requirements are that the copyright notice and permission
notice be included in all copies, and that the software is provided "as is"
without warranty.

That's it. No restrictions on commercial use. No requirement to open source
derivative works. No patent clauses or contributor agreements.

## Why We Chose MIT

### Simplicity

Developers shouldn't need a law degree to use a library. The MIT License is
about 170 words. You can read it in under a minute and understand exactly what
you're agreeing to. When someone evaluates our tools, license review takes
seconds, not hours.

### Maximum Adoption

We build developer tools because we want developers to use them. Restrictive
licenses create friction. Legal teams flag GPL dependencies. Startups worry
about copyleft obligations. Enterprise companies have approved license lists
that exclude certain options.

The WordPress ecosystem illustrates how GPL licensing can create ongoing
tension. Because WordPress itself is GPL, themes and plugins that integrate
with it inherit those obligations. This has fueled years of debate about what
constitutes a derivative work, culminating in high-profile disputes that
distract from actually building software. We'd rather avoid that complexity
entirely.

MIT appears on virtually every corporate approved list. It's compatible with
nearly every other license. It works for side projects, startups, and Fortune
500 companies alike. When we release a tool, we want it to help as many
developers as possible.

### Reciprocity Isn't Required

Some argue that copyleft licenses like GPL ensure contributions flow back to
the community. That's a valid perspective, but it's not how we think about our
tools.

We release these projects because they solve problems we had. If someone uses
our PHPStan rule or shell script linter without contributing back, that's fine.
They're still getting value. If they build something proprietary on top of our
code, that's fine too. The original project remains available to everyone.

Contributions are welcome, but we don't want to mandate them through legal
mechanisms.

### The Tools We Use Are MIT

Our projects build on MIT-licensed foundations. Laravel is MIT. Many of the
Vim plugins we depend on are MIT. The JavaScript ecosystem runs largely on MIT.
Using the same license keeps things simple and consistent.

## When MIT Might Not Be Right

MIT isn't the answer for every project. If you're building something where you
genuinely need patent protection, Apache 2.0 provides explicit patent grants.
If you believe strongly in copyleft principles and want to ensure derivatives
remain open, GPL serves that purpose.

For application code where you want to prevent competitors from taking your
work closed-source, a copyleft license makes sense. For infrastructure
projects where you want to monetize enterprise features, licenses like AGPL or
source-available options might align better with your business model.

## Our Commitment

Every BuiltFast open source project uses the MIT License. When you evaluate
our tools, you know exactly what you're getting: code you can use however you
want, with no strings attached beyond preserving the copyright notice.

We believe the best tools spread because they're useful, not because legal
restrictions force adoption. MIT embodies that philosophy.
