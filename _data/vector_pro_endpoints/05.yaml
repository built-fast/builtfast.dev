  View event logs for Vector Pro resources. Events are logged automatically when
  actions occur (site creation, deployments, etc.) and are retained for 90 days.

  Event logs provide an audit trail of all activity in your account.

  #### Event Naming Convention

  Events follow a consistent dot-notation pattern:
  - Simple actions: `{entity}.{action}` (e.g., `site.created`, `site.updated`)
  - Lifecycle operations: `{entity}.{operation}.{phase}` (e.g., `site.provisioning.started`)
