  Manage serverless WordPress sites deployed on Vector Pro infrastructure. Sites are
  the primary resource representing customer applications, each with associated
  environments (staging/production), deployments, and CDN configurations.

  Sites are created with a `pending` status and transition to `active` once provisioning
  completes. You can suspend sites to reduce costs during low-traffic periods.

  #### Site Status Lifecycle

  - `pending` - Site creation initiated, provisioning in progress
  - `active` - Site is fully operational and serving traffic
  - `suspended` - Site is paused to reduce costs (can be unsuspended)
  - `terminating` - Site deletion in progress
  - `terminated` - Site has been fully removed

      groupDescription: |-

        Manage serverless WordPress sites deployed on Vector Pro infrastructure. Sites are
        the primary resource representing customer applications, each with associated
        environments (staging/production), deployments, and CDN configurations.

        Sites are created with a `pending` status and transition to `active` once provisioning
        completes. You can suspend sites to reduce costs during low-traffic periods.

        #### Site Status Lifecycle

        - `pending` - Site creation initiated, provisioning in progress
        - `active` - Site is fully operational and serving traffic
        - `suspended` - Site is paused to reduce costs (can be unsuspended)
        - `terminating` - Site deletion in progress
        - `terminated` - Site has been fully removed

      title: 'Delete Site'
      description: |-
        Initiates deletion of a site. This terminates the site's development container
        and CDN resources. The site status transitions to `terminating` and eventually
        `terminated`.

        **Important:** All environments must be terminated before the site can be deleted.
        Use the environment delete endpoint to terminate each environment first.

        This operation is irreversible. All site data and configurations will be
        permanently removed.

        Clone an existing site's development container to create a new site.

      title: 'Clone Site'
      description: |-
        Creates a new site by cloning an existing site's development container,
        including files and database. Only the development container is cloned;
        production and staging environments are not copied. The new site is created
        with fresh, empty environments.

        This workflow is useful for testing larger redesigns or refactors in
        isolation while still allowing maintenance of the original site. The cloned
        site operates independently, so changes to one do not affect the other.

        The new site inherits attributes from the source site unless overridden in
        the request. The cloned site is created with a `pending` status and will
        transition to `active` once the clone operation completes.
